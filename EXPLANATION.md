What I changed (high level)
- Added a "Concat Deluxe" family of effects to the project that perform advanced concatenation/reshuffle/cut behaviors commonly used in YTP editing: ConcatDeluxe, RandomClipShuffle, RandomCuts, and ChaosTimeline.
- Implemented robust ffmpeg-backed helpers to extract segments, build concat lists, shuffle or reorder them, and create final concatenated outputs.
- Integrated these behaviors into the ffmpeg backend using special markers (e.g. "__CONCAT_DELUXE__", "__RANDOM_CLIP_SHUFFLE__", "__RANDOM_CUTS__", "__CHAOS_TIMELINE__") that the effect factories return as extras.
- Kept the API consistent with the existing pipeline: effects produce (vf, af, extras) and the backend handles extras. GUI does not require modificationâ€”the new effects appear in the registry and are available to add to the timeline.
- Improved error reporting for the concat functions so ffmpeg errors propagate with helpful messages.

How to use
1. Add the new effect(s) in the GUI timeline: ConcatDeluxe, RandomClipShuffle, RandomCuts, or ChaosTimeline.
2. Configure probability and max level like other effects.
   - For RandomClipShuffle: level -> number of clips (1..level*4) and clip length is varied.
   - For RandomCuts: level -> number of cuts (higher -> more chaotic micro-cuts).
   - ConcatDeluxe: safe default that slices the file into a few parts, reverses or duplicates randomly.
   - ChaosTimeline: will slice and randomly apply other simple effects to each slice (experimental).
3. Render. The backend will create temporary segment files, shuffle/reorder them, and concat using ffmpeg concat demuxer for best compatibility.

Notes & limitations
- These operations create many temporary files; ensure you have disk space.
- For best audio/video compatibility the concat demuxer requires identical codec/parameters across segments. The helper normalizes segments by re-encoding to libx264 + aac before concat.
- Large inputs or high cut counts may be slow. Preview mode (6s) will limit durations for faster iteration.
- If you get an ffmpeg error, run the app from a console (python main.py) to see the detailed ffmpeg stderr, then paste it and I will debug further.

If you want, I can:
- Add GUI parameters (clip count, min/max length, micro-cut length) for each concat effect.
- Optimize by concatenating using stream-copy when inputs are already uniform (faster, less re-encoding).
- Add an option to export each segment to an assets folder for manual editing.
