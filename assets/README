Assets folder
=============

This project expects optional user-provided assets for some effects. Create the following structure under the project root:

assets/
  memes/          (images, gifs, short videos and audio clips for Meme Injection)
  sounds/         (audio clips for Add Random Sound)
  rainbow.png     (a rainbow overlay image for RainbowOverlay effect)
  xp_sounds/      (Windows XP sounds for Classic Nostalgia Mode)

Notes:
- Overlays should have transparent backgrounds (PNG or GIF) to look best.
- Audio samples can be mp3, wav, ogg, or m4a.
- Some effects are placeholders and will look best if you populate assets with content.
